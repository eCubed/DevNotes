# Angular Material, FlexLayout, and Reactive Forms - Reflection

This whole series has tightly packed together three major concepts - Angular Material, FlexLayout, and Reactive Forms, almost as if they're inseparable. In fact, each
of the three is independent from each other, and I should have dedicated a series for each one so we could all focus on one of them. I am going to be creating separate
Angular sections for each of these three. I realize that I've put them all under Material. I'll leave all the Material Journals intact, but I'll rename the folder
"Old Journals".

For the Flex Layout series, I will omit Reactive Forms and Angular Material. I'll stick with plain html input elements.

For the Material Series, I may use Flex Layout but will not discuss it. To leave out Reactive Forms may be a bit of a challenge.

To address Reactive Forms, I'll leave out Material, but may use Flex Layout without discussing it.
