# Switching from Sublime to Atom

Today, I've decided to migrate to Atom. I've used Sublime for the last 3 years. It was OK untli recently when it became so dreadfully
slow, even just to load a project's file structure on the project explorer. I'm supposedly behind the times, though I've heard of Atom
for quite some time.

I downloaded and installed it. I didn't have any problems navigating through the editor. I was able to open an entire project (folder),
create files and folders, delete them, rename them, edit, and save. One little thing I noticed was I did not get auto-completion to close
HTML tags, which Sublime Text and Visual Studio gave me for free. It turns out that there are a few plugins I need to install. Well,
I guess, it's a "let the fun begin" moment.
