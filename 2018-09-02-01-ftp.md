# FTP Setup on Linux

## FTP as Priority in Current Learning Path
Yesterday, I discussed what I wanted to tackle after having successfully set up my name server and serve basic domain and
subdomain websites. I didn't decide on what order I'll pursue them in. Today, I realized what I believe at the moment is the
best order:

1. **FTP.** Since one of my largest goals was to serve Asp.NET Core applications with Linux, I figure that I would need to
copy published output files to the server. So, before I even set up Asp.NET Core runtimes in my VPS, I need to first learn
how to allow an authorized user to upload files in general to the server.
2. **Installing Asp.NET Core Runtimes.** I'm a developer, so I've been working more with the SDK. I know that a runtime needs
to be installed for framework-dependent deployments. No, I will not publish self-contained projects because they are large
in size! It turns out that it's not a simple download and install like we have in Windows.
3. **Deploy Quick Demo Asp.NET Core Web Applications.** I will develop small demo web applications to get a feel and
demonstrate a project developed in Windows to run on Linux. I think that one of the deploy options in Visual Studio is FTP,
so we'll see how that works. So, it's good that I prioritized FTP. Each of these apps will be a website with its own
subdomain.
4. **SSL and Certificates**. Secure connection is becoming a crucial part of development and deployment nowadays, and I need
to get into the game. My host gives me 1 free wildcard SSL, so I'll use it for my domain and its subdomains.
5. **Email Server**. I have always taken this for granted because my past hosts have always set this up for me automatically,
complete with the email server itself, email management in a control panel, and an actual live website where I and email accounts
I create may login and manage email like anywhere else.
6. **MySQL**. I'm putting this one as a last priority because I am at this time uncertain about how this works with Entity
Framework, namely code-first development and database migrations. Though an application may be hosted on Linux, it can still
connect to a MSSQL server. I am more concerned about setting up a secured website with the most crucial features (before data).

## FTP K in KWL

My first FTP experience was in college when all of its students were granted a then-generous 4 megabytes of hard disk space
to store HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, as well as images. They set it up so that the name portion of our college email addresses
was the ftp user name, the password being the same password as the one for our email client, and gave us access to only the
4 MB-capped folder where we would transfer our website files to.

Later when I first tried to be a client of web hosting, I also used the FTP capability they offered to transfer my Asp.NET
files. I had more of an administrative role because through the account control panel, I could create FTP users and restrict
them.

I recently learned that FTP communicates through port 21, so I would need to add that as an exception to the firewall.

## FTP W in KWL

1. I'm almost certain that FTP users are NOT the same users as the Linux OS users, so I'm not 100% sure. So, are my Linux
users (including root) automatically the FTP users?
2. Do I need to add an A or CNAME record to DNS for the FTP, which one, or both, or not even? I thought only web requests
go through port 80 or 443, and if FTP goes through port 21, DNS is irrelevant for it.
3. How do I create and delete users?
4. How do I manage each user's password (like reset when they forget it)?
5. How do I set a starting folder for a user when they first log in?
6. How do I declare which folders that user may access outside that starting folder?
5. Will setting up FTP interfere with Nginx or BIND? I have a feeling that it may, but Nginx and BIND are concerned with
only ports 80 and 443, though.
6. How do I install FTP into my Linux VPS? Do I have to do anything before I can just install it ala Nuget or npm-like fashion?
7. How, if possible, do I set up FTP deployment in Visual Studio once I've set up the FTP properly?

## FTP L in KWL

My initial research on FTP invalidates a some my W (of KWL) efforts, though address some of them.

I knew that FTP is an older technology, but only now did I learn that FTP is not secure, meaning, the files, and even
credentials are transferred through the wire in plain text. So, I decided not to use FTP for security reasons. This knowledge
invalidates questions 6 and 7.

There is a newer and more secure way to transfer files from dev machine to the VPS, and that is called SFTP, the same protocol
on port 22 that I use to get into my VPS using PuTTY. It turns out that when I installed PuTTY, the installer installed other
programs alongside PuTTY. One of those other programs is PSFTP, which is also a CLI used to transfer files (both download
from VPS to dev machine and upload from dev machine to VPS). This addresses some questions I asked above:

- **Are Linux users automatically the FTP (now SFTP) users?** Yes, they are. This means that any user created by a sudo account
with PuTTY can log into PSFTP using the same credentials.
- **How do I create and delete users?** We don't in PSFTP. We do it through PuTTY with Linux commands.
- **How do I manage each user's password?** We don't in PSFTP. We do it through PuTTY with Linux commands.
- **How do I set a starting folder for a user when they first log in?** We don't in PSFTP. When we created a user via PuTTY, we
also created a home directory for that user with a helper. When the user logs into PSFTP, they immediately land on that
home directory?
- **How do I declare which folders that user may access outside that starting folder?** We don't in PSFTP. This issue is about
file and folder permissions, which we haven't delved into at all at this time. If we deny access to a folder for a particular
user, they will not be able to access (read, write, or both) that folder from PSFTP.
- **Will setting up FTP (now SFTP) interfere with Nginx or BIND?** No. We already have PSFTP that we can use, so there will be
no need to even touch DNS or even set up some website that would perform FTP work.
- **Do I need to add an A or CNAME record to DNS for the FTP, which one, or both, or not even?** Not even. We already have
PSFTP that we can use, so there will be no need to even touch DNS or even set up some website that would perform FTP work.

## New W in KWL After Learning of PSFTP

I've addressed all of my questions. Now, I have the following questions:

1. Navigation of the VPS file system is quite similar in PSFTP to PuTTY, however, *how* do I actually upload a file or
files in a folder to my VPS?
2. What are permissions in Linux and how do I set, unset, and view them?

## Uploading Files to the VPS

Upon further searching on how to use PSFTP, I came across WinSCP - what PSFTP is with a GUI. So, downloaded and installed it
on my Windows machine. I logged in with my VPS credentials. No explanation needed - it works like a charm, just like good old
WSFTP, but it's secure. We've addressed #1 from the previous section.

## Next Steps

We will need to research on permissions per file or folder for a more thorough understanding of how files are protected in the
OS. This may play a role when we deploy to production because the website folder of an app we'd like to serve may be too
secured.

Since we now have WinSCP, we can now go ahead and copy production output to the folder we want in the server.
