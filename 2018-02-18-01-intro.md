# My Intro to Python

I've known about Python for quite some time but I never delved into it too much. I've only tried it out from inside Blender for some scripting to create basic mathematical shapes in 3D. Beyond that,
nothing, because why bother if I already know platforms and programming languages that create mobile apps, websites, console, and desktop applications, right?

Right now, I'm finding lots of downtime, so, why not learn something I've purposely overlooked for decades? Besides, I could use it in future projects, so it's not a total waste of time to occupy my
downtime learning it.

There are other things that I don't know or don't know very well, like PHP and JSP, C++, Java, React, etc. But today, Python wins my "next pursuit endeavor", for really no good reason. Actually, one
of my recent projects (that I've already completed) depends on a program written in Python. No, I didn't need to learn it. I just needed to launch the executable from inside my C# console app and it
does its job that I need. So, there we have it - a python-built program that piqued my curiosity enough to begin learning it.

## Initial Questions

1. Why would people want to program in Python? [Here](https://www.codingdojo.com/blog/why-you-should-learn-python)
2. What can Python do that JavaScript or C# can't?
3. What IDE can I use to create Python code? Can I use VS Code?
4. How do I build/run python code? Is there such a thing as the distinction between production vs. development?
5. How do I get 3rd Party Python libraries, or what would be the equivalent of NuGet that I use in C#, or npm for Angular?
6. Is there such a thing as a Python project structure already laid out for me like what I get when starting a C# or Angular project?
7. What will be my approach in learning Python? Do I go through mini-tutorials from everywhere that I'll have to piece together? Read blogs? Take course? Buy a book?
8. What would be my development environment?

## Plan

Obviously, I'll need to install it in my system. I guess I'll start how I usually start - create a "Hello World" application. But then, I'll need to learn right away how to deploy the project and run it.

I think that I'll learn the following concepts in the order given below:

* Install it
* Hello World
* Primitive data types, including assignment, basic computation, and string manipulation
* Taking input from the user
* Read simple strings from files
* Explore OOP
* Manage a project with multiple files - AKA project (like how do I do `using` or `import` in Python)
* Install and use external libraries (like does it install globally or a per-project basis)
* Deal with JSON
