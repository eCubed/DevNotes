# Code Editors

I develop for both front-end and back-end, and recently gained some experience in setting up a web server in Linux. This article is about my preferences of which
code editors and/or IDEs I currently use.

**Visual Studio 2017 for Back-end Web Applications.** This is a no-brainer because VS 2017 is official. It lets me debug my app and deploy to production very easily.
I also get my much-needed Intellisense.
**Sublime Text for Front-End Web.** I have been using this for 3 years, honestly, because it was popular and made me feel like a true front-end developer. But in the
last year, it has become so slow that it takes forever just to load even only the file-directory structure of an Angular app. I think I'm making a switch to Atom.
**nano in Linux.** I had experience with vi back in college, and boy, was it, and still is tough to use. Nano, to me, is far more obvious and predictable to use
