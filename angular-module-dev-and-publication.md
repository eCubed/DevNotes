# Angular 6+ Module Development and Publication

One major Angular feature that I ignored for the longest time in my Angular development is developing in modules and then publishing them to be used in many apps.
I used to create components, services, classes, etc., in one app, and ended up copying them to other apps. The maintenance effort got really out of hand. There is
now a need to centralize development of common services and components! How would I pull this!?
