# Angular Material and Flex Layout - Laying out Forms

We have some experience laying out a website's navigation and presenting data items using Material and Flex Layout. We will now apply our knowledge and learn
more in order to properly lay out a form.

As a review, let's remember that Material bears the look of components, not positioning, margins, or dimensions, and Flex Layout helps us declaratively specify
in markup what happens to the sizes and placements of components on different widths. Since we are working with Flex Layout, let us remember that a parent
container is a flow, and not a grid, which means children would be layed out in one horizontal row or one vertical column.

If we had previous experience with laying out forms before, we are in for a bit of a surprise because the markup is vastly different.
