# Diving In

I've done some research on what it's like to host website on a Linux VPS. I am pursuing it for the following reasons:

- I feel the need to learn beyond my comfort zone of Windows hosting, as we may soon need to launch projects in the Linux platform.
If we don't end up using Linux, at least I will have added something to add to my CV.
- They say that overall performance is faster than Windows VPS.
- Linux VPS is cheaper than Windows VPS.
- I can deploy Asp.NET Core applications to Linux. I can still develop it in Windows, but serve the published package from Linux.

However, at the same time, this endeavor may be frightening because:

- To lower costs, I will need to choose an unmanaged plan. This means that I will have to do my own backup, protection, server monitoring,
and other administration tasks that I may have even heard of in Windows.
- The tasks that I performed in Windows with a GUI, I now have to do them from a command line interface. This means a lot of memorizing and typing.
- Since I will be primarily serving Asp.NET Core apps, I don't think I can even get a free control panel like ZPanelCP or VirtualAdmin because
their website automatically create PHP.
- As with learning anything, the information I find may be outdated or wrong, especially when it comes to setting up and configuring stuff.

## What are my First Tasks?

- I'll still be working from a Windows machine, so I'll need to get an SSH client, maybe PuTTY so I can connect to my VPS.
- Log into the root account, change the root password.
- Add users so I don't do everything from root. At least this is the advice I've seen from many different places.

## Immediate Goals

At first, I do not need to put up an official personal website, since I don't even know how to set up a Linux VPS to do all of that. I'm new to all
of this, so I will begin with creating a bunch of Hello World applications.

- Set up DNS for domain and subdomains. I'll have to find the software I would want to install.
- Set up a web server so that I can expose the web content of the domain and subdomains.
- Create my first hello world applications. The first one will probably NOT be an Asp.NET Core Application. It'll be a single index.html page
with the CSS in it, no JavaScript, that says hello world. This will probably be on the main site.

## Research and Decide Which Software To Use

- For DNS configuration, I don't know what's available. Again, since this is a non-urgent educational effort for myself, I will not obtain even
a free control panel.
- For the web server, there's Apache and Nginx. I know Apache will serve PHP. I'm not sure yet what the difference is between the two, or others.
- I already know that I'll need to install Asp.NET Core 2.0 to current stable runtimes.
- We'll be working with MySQL. We'll know we'll install MySQL server so that we can connect to it for development. Also, if possible, we would
like to install a MySQL studio management software in Windows that can connect to the mysql on our VPS. There is 
(MySQL Workbench)[https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/] for Windows. I figure that it has a connection window where I type either the IP
address, then my credentials, then I'm good to go!
