# Learning Approaches to Linux VPS Administration and Development

There is a huge load of stuff to learn when we decide to learn how to serve websites with a Linux distribution. It's good that we have learned some
basic website administration and DNS from the Windows environment, and have recently had some command line experience with `dotnet` and `npm`. I
think that a good general approach is to ask what the command line counterpart is of a task that we used to perform by interacting with a UI.

## What to Learn In Order on the Command Prompt

1. **Navigate the file system.** This includes moving from one folder to another, viewing the contents of the current folder, along with some of the
options for modifying how to display which pieces of data to display about files and subfolders.
2. **Manipulating files and folders.** This includes creating files and folders, renaming them, deleting them, and moving them to other folders.
3. **Running an application.** We have some experience with this. We did it on a Bash shell and ran `npm` and `dotnet`, which are applications. Perhaps
the first applications we need to learn about include command line text editors and finding and installing software from the Internet.
4. **Learn command line text editors.** This is quite important because we will probably need to write and save scripts. We'll probably start with
creating plain text files to familiarize ourselves with the many keyboard shortcuts.
5. **Scripting for task management.** This is not to be confused with writing programming language code for an app. This is writing script in some
language that may automate tasks which may include file system navigation.
6. **What the essential administration programs and tasks are and how to use them.** We're a powerful user now, and we will need to perform administrative
tasks like system monitoring, upgrading software, tweaking settings and preferences, and the like. But first, we need to research what the essential
programs and tasks are, and how to use them. Essential in this case, should be the ones that already come with the distribution.

## How do we Research?

Unfortunately, we may not currently have funds to pay for courses on how to administer a Linux server, and we will need to sift through a ton of
StackOverflow, blogs, articles, and YouTube videos for various concepts and how-tos. With that said, we MUST be extra-patient, and remember that
putting up a personal website isn't urgent. We will need to expect some outdated and outright wrong information, as we've experienced with learning
any framework or platform.

We may also consult some old Unix or Linux books from the library. Yes, Linux server administration feels old school, and so will be some of the
education! And no, we shouldn't read those books cover to cover!

## What is my Desktop Setup for Learning?

Desktop refers to my computer monitors and the top surface of my workstation. Ideally, we should have two monitors - one for research (the web browser)
and the other for both documentation and development. For learning the Linux server, we would have browser on the left monitor, and the SSH shell on
the right monitor. On my literal desktop, I will need to have pen and paper ready for on-the-spot urgent writing that I cannot easily do on the computer.
Yes, there will be times that a helpful idea comes to mind in the middle of documenting on the computer, and we don't want to lose the cursor position
on the screen, or we read something that sparks a somewhat (or totally) unrelated idea that is not the topic of the currently opened documentation we're
drafting on the screen.

## Documenting our Learning Experience?

This is for me particularly, but you are welcome to follow along and use any parts of my experience as you see fit in yours.

**KWL.** Much of my writing when trying to learn something consists of a list of things I know or think I know, my questons, and finally, what I've
learned from researching. I've adapted this tool from Education and I find it extremely useful. In general, I always begin with a topic I want to
learn. Then based on my experiences and what I've learned before about the topic, I list down what I *know*, hence the *K* in *KWL*. Then, as a learner,
I write down any of my questions, which are questions on *what*, hence the *W* in *KWL* I want or need to know. Then I go ahead and do my research.
It is normal that as we research, we will have more questions, so I add those questions. When I find my answers, I write them below the question.
The answers are the *L* in *KWL*, meaning what we've **learned** from researching.

At the end, I go back and read the KWL document, make some edits, and out of it, create the actual instructional document.

**The Instructional Document.** I believe that to teach is to learn twice, and by writing instructions on the concepts and how-tos of something, we gain
a better and thorough understanding. Why and how? Because as we write instructions, we anticipate what a reader might ask or the fact that people learn
in different ways. We will think of fitting analogies. We may rewrite a process in a different order, for example, one being from the perspective of a
user vs. a developer vs. computer. I personally also like to include pitfalls or what I think are easy mistakes to make. There are many things that
seem obvious but they end up being more involved.
