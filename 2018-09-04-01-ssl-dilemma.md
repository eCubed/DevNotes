# SSL Dilemma

I briefly looked into obtaining an SSL certificate for my VPS with my host and I might have a major problem. From the beginning, I decided to keep separate the
domain name registrar and host. This way, I could change hosts at any time and just point my domain name to the new host's name servers. I signed up to my host
not specifying a specific domain my plan was for, since they gave me the option to omit a domain name. Had I specified a domain name, they'd automatically also
become the registrar, which I didn't want.

Upon attempting to generate my SSL certificate through the account control panel, I found out that they needed a domain set up under my account, and I didn't have
a domain under my host. The options were to transfer my domain name to them so they'd become my new registrar, to register a fresh domain name with them, or to
register an external domain. It looked to me that registering the external domain was the best option since I didn't want to transfer my domain records or get a
new domain name.

So, I tried to register the external domain, but they asked for the name servers and IP addresses of those name servers. Two were required, however, both of the
name servers couldn't have the same IP address. They also gave me the option (actually told me that they preferred this option, but I didn't) to use *their*
name servers and told me to notify my registrar of those name servers. This would mean that I would lose my custom name server.

So far, I will not be able to create an SSL certificate via the control panel. I will need to literally speak to tech support regarding this one. I did read
somewhere, though, that my fix would not be possible via the control panel, but via email. The article didn't really elaborate on it.

## Next Steps

At this point, I know I won't pursue serving email, and now SSL is uncertain until I speak with tech support. I've already solved the domain and website serving
issues, and was able to deploy an Asp.NET Core app to a Linux server. I'm left with MySQL.
