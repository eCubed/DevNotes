# Visual Studio Templating Primer

Since we have developed quite a few projects, we may have noticed that the start of our development
is very similar across projects, if not, nearly identical except for the name of the website or company name.
When we created new projects, we have literally created files from scratch, cut-copy-pasted a lot of code
snippets from existing projects, and performed a significant amount of string replacement. This is
tedious, time-consuming, and error-prone.

We will no longer create files from scratch and manually copy code from existing projets. In this series, we
will complete a template for an **entire solution**. Once our template is complete, we will be able to
create a starting solution, with a few clicks and minimal typing via the UI, complete with starting
business logic, EF implementation, auth server, resource server, file server, and dev and prod deploy
projects. We would be able to start coding for our app's data and logic right away. 

We will develop the template both in Visual Studio and Notepad, as some of the files cannot be directly
edited from inside Visual Studio. Be forewarned that the code we will write in Visual Studio is going to
be syntactically wrong because it will contain placeholders inserted in many places that would cause
Intellisense to mark our code wrong. 

We will NOT focus on the logic of the code generated by the template. We will assume that the code is correct,
will build without errors, and will function as expected once we test and deploy the app later. We will be concerned 
about template placeholders in the C# code and the declarations in the template XMLs.

The following code generated is Asp.net Core 2.0.
