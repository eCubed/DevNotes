# Python Programming Curiosities

I'm going through the tutorials on [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/python) and I'm coming up with some questions that I don't think the tutorial covered.

1. Are primitives (numbers, strings, booleans) pass-by-value and others pass-by-reference just like in JS and C#?
2. Does Python have interfaces as in Java, C#, and C++?
3. Does Python have generic type parameters?
4. Are global variables available throughout ALL .py files in a project, or just within that one file?
5. Does python resolve the situation where we have 2+ modules in our program that we import into the main module, and they all import some of the same modules?
6. For a dictionary type, is `myDict.key` valid and equivalent to `myDict["key"]` like it would be in JS?
7. Can we cast a dictionary type to a custom object type, provided that the dictionary has matching keys with property names of the object property names?
8. Does the built-in JSON module have an easy way to serialize a custom object into a JSON string?
9. Does Python have multithreading?
