# SCSS Reboot

I have used SCSS in my projects, however, I don't know what I've done probably more than half the time. I know that I can split SCSS in multiple files and import
one on another, and have done so, however, not really thinking about app organization. This article isn't a SASS or CSS tutorial, but is a discussion on where to
put which SCSS files, and which ones to set up with the intent of being imported into others.

Some of my problems include:

* **Not understanding Angular CSS scopes.** What exactly is the global CSS scope? I thought that everything that I put in the starting `styles.scss` page will apply
all the way the child-most component. What if I don't want a particular component to inherit the style of any of its descendant components, including global? I also
noticed that certain CSS that I defined in a component actually applied to other components that aren't even its children. So, I'm really confused!
* **Having redundant CSS blocks across different components.** Perhaps this stems from not understanding CSS scopes, but possibly also not really understanding
mixins and the % placeholder in SASS. I often type the same CSS class, name and all its rules, over and over again just so my components look right.
* **Not being weary of final CSS output.** I did not know that importing the same SCSS files (that have explicit classes, etc) from different components will actually
cause duplicates in the final CSS output. I always thought that this would be automatically resolved. I guess not. I don't know how to avoid this without letting
the look of my components suffer.
* **Writing CSS that depends on HTML Markup.** I didn't know this was a problem, and I still do it! Are we now supposed to write SCSS rules with no knowledge of a
target element's even relative location in the DOM tree?

Terminology and concepts I've heard of, possibly even researched, and still don't understand:

* View/style encapsulation
* Shadow DOM
* :host pseudo-selector
* SASS mixins
