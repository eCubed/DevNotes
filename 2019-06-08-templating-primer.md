# Angular Templating

One of the first things we learned in Angular is that we develop components, and we can nest them to create our applications. In fact, the top-level of our app *is*
a component. And each component is separated into the controller (the .ts file), the stylesheet (.scss or .css), and finally the template (.html). The template is
where we put our markup along with references to variables we declare and functions we implement in the .ts file. For many applications, this use of templates is
sufficient and we can call it a day. However, there are more to Angular templates than just the .html files where we lay out our component. In this series, we will
explore more advanced templating features that will allow us to create more robust components.
