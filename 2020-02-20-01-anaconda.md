# Python and Anaconda

I installed Python version 3.8.1 off the website and the installation did come with `pip` - the "vanilla" package manager for Python. This way, I can install Python modules (that didn't come with Python)
to my system and use them in my apps.

But there is another thing I came across regarding Python, and that is Anaconda. What is it? I'm getting mixed answers, but I'll try to make sense out of all the info I'm getting. Anaconda is an entire
development system INCLUDING a package manager (beyond that of `pip`), some other software (like a Python development IDE (but I'm already using and prefer VS Code')), some preinstalled packages that 
don't come with the standard Python installation, and many ways to be able to easily develop apps that utilize deep learning, AI, media processing, big data, etc. It also has a well-established framework
for sharing and collaborating with other Python developers (especially for scientific/research work).

I went to the download page for Anaconda and selected the latest package appropriate for my system. One thing that is quite confusing to me is that I first installed Python 3.8.1, but this Anaconda
distribution came with Python 3.7. I probably have both Python versions in my system, just like I have multiple versions of .NET. Now, if I run a Python program at the prompt with simply `python main.py`,
which Python version will execute? It turns out that it's still Python 3.8.1 since that's what shows up when I run `python --version` at the prompt.

OK. Now what do I do with Anaconda now that it's installed in my system? For now, nothing much. I'm sure I'll come across the need.

BUT, how did I come across Anaconda exactly? I wanted to get into CUDA development with Python, and apparently, Anaconda is required for it.
