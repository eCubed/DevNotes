# Starting a Main Journals Section

I've been working in software development for about ten years, though my programming experience goes back further. It was only very
recently that I decided that it was time to document my learning experience into a dedicated Git repository. I'll confess that for the
longest time, I thought of noting down my findings but I never did. Many times, I was pressed for time to complete a project. My
process was often (1) find the answer on some blog, forum, or official documentation, (2) quickly implement it on a project to address
the problem, and (3) forget about it. I would go through the same process over and over again, EVEN for the SAME ANSWERS, and I'd still
often forget about what it is that I learned. Even when I wasn't pressed for time, I didn't bother writing down my findings. I thought
that I would eventually learn it well enough until I never had to research it again. Well, software development is quickly evolving,
and there are way too many things to learn and I just couldn't memorize everything. I finally decided to gather all of my research
findings into a single Git repo so that I wouldn't have to Google for the same answers over and over again!

I initially started arranging writeups in folders based on platform (like Asp.NET Core and Angular), specific libraries (like Newtonsoft),
Tools (like Git and Nuget), setup (like Hosting), and tasks (like unit testing). This kind of organization allows me to be able to more
efficiently find answers later on, and yes, I have referred to my notes quite often. There is also something about writing (at least
for me) that helps info stick to my brain quite effectively, and also lets me understand the material with further depth.

At this point, I don't really have an established format. I pretty much jot down what I find. However, I have the tendency to write
a few types of articles. In a **journal**, I present a need or a problem that needs to be solved, tell of my efforts to research it,
my experiences trying the suggested or official solutions, and then reflecting on what I've learned. I speak as if I am actually
telling and showing someone what I'm going through or have gone through. In an **instruction** type of writing, I present the problem
as I do in a journal, and I lay down the steps. I may present some tips and pitfalls, but I don't typically reflect in an instruction.
I also have **reference** material, which are best used to list and break down commands (that we type in a CLI), and useful functions
of a published library. References are supposed to be quick with as little explanation as possible.

But why am I starting a main journals section? It's supposed to be a general journal that doesn't typically target a particular
framework or programming language, though entries may talk about some computer science concepts. I'll also include my thoughts on
how to better organize this entire repository.
