# Ordered A VPS Host

I signed up for an entry level VPS Hosting Plan at 1&1 - the Virtual Server Cloud M, unmanaged, with Ubuntu 18.04. At this time, there was
an offer of $4.99/mo for the first 12 months, then $9.99/mo month 13 and after.

## First Email - Confirmation of Order Made
They sent me an order confirmation email thanking me for the order, confirming what I ordered. This email does not contain the IP of the VPS
or any login credentials. At this time, they only gave me my customer ID and a link to their account control panel (not to be mistaken with a
VPS control panel which this plan doesn't even come with).

When I log into the account control panel, it tells me that my order is still in process and can take upto 48 hours.

## Second Email - Request for Valid ID
Shortly after receiving the first email, I received a separate email from the company asking me to provide a digital copy of a valid form
of identification. I replied a copy of my passport (info page) and driver's license.

## Third Email - Confirmation of Order Completion 
I now received the confirmation email stating that my order has been completed. There is a Set Up Server Now button later in the email.
It takes me to the account control panel, already logged in, and to the Servers Page. This is where I can view system monitoring info,
the IP address, and my login credentials.

## Next Steps
The next step is to login to the server via SSH client and perform administration tasks like update the system, create users, etc.
