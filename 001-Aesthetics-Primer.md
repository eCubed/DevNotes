# Aesthetics Primer

This section is meant to explore and focus on "looking good". No, this is NOT too focused on UX, as that is more about effectiveness and having the
user accomplish tasks and solve problems. Effective and efficient UX does NOT have to be beautiful - in fact, even an ugly user interface that adhere
to principles (like proximity, uniformity, hierarchy, etc.) will accomplish goals. Though we might touch a little on UX here, we'll focus more on
the eye candy part, but not overdoing it to interfere with the user's tasks.

So, in this volume, I'll focus on artistry, graphics software, web design, and even audio mastering.
