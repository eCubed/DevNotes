# Second Reflection of Today

# Email?

I've decided to look into possibly serving email from my VPS. From reading a few articles on setting up email, it turns out to be a lot of
work, in fact, too much, especially to maintain. There are supposed shortcut installers that make setup easier, however, the system 
requirements exceed my system configuration, so I can't do it.

# Next Steps?

So now, email will be put in the bottom of the priority list. The next quest is to host an Asp.NET Core web application.

Then SSL. Then MySQL.
