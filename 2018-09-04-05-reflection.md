# End-of-Day Reflection

I accomplished two major feats today - set up MySQL and SSL. I'm quite pleased and surprised that I pulled these off!

So what's next? I'm back to Asp.NET Core development to get my personal website back up, though I'll be making some changes to my previous
version. I'll discuss my personal website in another volume.

The following remain for me to explore and finalize:

1. **Environment Variables In Linux.** I previously was able to save sensitive data to environment variables that resolved to a property of a
custom configuration object for production. I imagine that my code to pull values from environment variables that worked in a Windows server will
work in Linux as well. But, I'm not sure how to set environmental variables in Linux. My hunch says I might set it in an Nginx server file.
2. **How to change the deployed web app port to other than 5000.** By default, a deployed Asp.NET Core app will run on port 5000. I'll have
tons of subdomains, so I'll need to be able to specify a unique port. Hopefully, I'm able to set these port numbers on a configuration file
so I'll just read the value off the configuration file.
3. **MySQL and Entity Frmaework.** There are libraries we can use for this, which contain extensions so that we can tell the database we've
grown accustomed to will talk to MySQL instead of MSSQL. No, we will not write ADO.NET-like code. We will be able to use LINQ. But they said that
Asp.NET Core 2.1 isn't yet supported. I'm not sure if I can develop code-first, let alone migrate to database with MySQL.
4. **Permissions and Ownership in Linux.** This is still very cloudy to me, so all I need to do is some research and hands-on tinkering to see
how thiese work.
