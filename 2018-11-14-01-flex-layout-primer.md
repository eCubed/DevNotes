# Flex Layout - Primer

If you were like me, predominantly a back-end developer who still needs to keep up with front-end technologies, you may have struggled a lot with web design, and one
of those problem areas was laying out elements on a page. CSS positioning and floating still haunts us to this day with its seemingly unpredictable nature. Some of us
may have touched CSS FlexBox, which turns out to be quite confusing as well. We're Angular developers, and there is a tool that makes it easier for us to create sure-fire,
consistent page and component layouts, and it is called `Flex Layout`.

`Flex Layout` is a tool that has us *declare* layout *right on html markup*. There are Angular directives that we can use that we can apply to regular html elements
that would regard them as either parent or child containers, or even both. `Flex Layout` is also *responsive*, where we have ways to declare some layout specifications
that should only apply to certain viewport widths. One of the major goals of `Flex Layout` is for us to *eliminate* putting CSS rules that specify width and positioning.
Yes, we'll still style with CSS, but now, our CSS will focus on the physical look (color, font, borders, shadowing, etc.) instead of layout. This tool is officially created
and endorsed by the Angular team, so this is not a third-party solution!

## Installation and Setup

In this series, I will be working with Angular 7. I'm starting with an app as generated by Angular CLI with the options `--style=scss --routing`.

We will need to install Flex Layout along with Angular CDK:

`npm i --save @angular/flex-layout @angular/cdk`

Now, we need to go to `app.module.ts` and import `FlexLayoutModule` and then add it to the `imports` array:

```javascript
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { FlexLayoutModule } from '@angular/flex-layout';

...

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    ...
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    AppRoutingModule,
    FlexLayoutModule
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

This way, we can use Flex Layout directives from any markup in our application.

## Next Steps

One core principle of Flex Layout is that we always need to designate a parent container and its immediate children. We need to be aware of this because certain directives
apply to parent and others apply to children. We'll first start with a simple component that has only 1 parent-child level hierarchy so we get to experience the basics of
Flex Layout.
