## Exploring other Stacks

I have touched PHP and Apache in the distant past, and I recently learned how to host with Linux. I am fairly familiar with MySQL because it is similar to MSSQL
in many ways. Therefore, I may play around with the LAMP Stack.

I've also worked with Java, including JSP and the JWT, but I didn't take it as far. There are still a lot of job postings for Java development, so I'm curious as to
what I would need to learn if I were to develop something in a Java Stack.

Yes, I want some experience in as many stacks as I want, but how do I set all of them up in the same machine without conflicting with each other (or will they?).
At least on my VPS, I have the "LNMA" stack (Linux, Nginx, MySQL, and Asp.NET Core). I don't think I can have Nginx and Apache running in the same machine, though,
since they both listen to the same port.
